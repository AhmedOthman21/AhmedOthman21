My journey began not with a grand career plan, but with a single, defining moment: a 4-year-old me, sitting in front of a computer, completely captivated by launching FIFA '98. This simple act ignited a lifelong passion for technology and a fascination with how things work under the hood. As I grew, this curiosity evolved into building and managing online game servers, which taught me invaluable lessons in perseverance and problem-solving.

After years of hands-on experience, I studied Business Administration to understand the psychology behind successful enterprises and learn how to build a tech company that could scale. My career has been a fusion of this technical passion and business acumen, starting with a dream to work for one international company, which multiplied into a journey with global giants like **Concentrix**, **Booking.com**, **VOIS**, **Western Union**, **IBM**, and **Microsoft**.
